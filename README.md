A minimal asynchronous interface to Webex Teams, intended for (but not
		limited to) implementing bots.

Current functionality includes:

- Registration with Webex APIs
- Monitoring an event stream
- Sending direct or group messages
- Getting room memberships
- Building AdaptiveCards and retrieving responses

Not all features are fully-fleshed out, particularly the AdaptiveCard
support (only a few serializations exist, enough to create a form with a
		few choices, a text box, and a submit button).
